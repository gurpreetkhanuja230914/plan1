no sql support large volume of data and its flexible nature support both
the type of data to be store that is nosql(real time analytics) and sql 
psql supprot two data types json and jsonb jsonb is more faster as data is already converted in 
json it also support indexing in jsonb through GIN generalized inverted index 
hstore is basically to store semi structured data as key value pair and sinlge data too but the json will store everthing as key value pair 
domain is created basically to check one attribute constraints 
create type is used to make a composite type and then we insert in it like a row(1,"ghdh","dhdhj) 
values of one column .
In PostgreSQL, an enum type is a custom data type that allows you to define a list of possible values for a column.
in enum we select any one from them and in type we can create a more then one attribute 
In PostgreSQL, an array of a collection of elements that have the same data type.
CREATE TABLE contacts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR (100),
  phones TEXT []
);
Feature	             JSON	                                                    JSONB
Storage	      Textual representation (verbatim)	                              Binary storage format
Size	      Typically larger it retains the whitespace in JSON data	   Typically smaller
Indexing	     Full-text search indexes	                                  Binary indexes
Performance	      Slightly slower	                                           Generally faster
Query performance	Slower due to parsing	                             Faster due to binary storage
Parsing	                Parse each time	                        Parse once, store in binary format
Data manipulation	           Simple and easy	                       More complex
Ordering of keys	Preserved	Not preserved
Duplicate keys	   Allow duplicate key, the last value is retained	   Do not allow duplicate keys.
Use cases	Storing configuration data, log data, simple JSON documents 	Storing JSON documents where fast querying and indexing are required
