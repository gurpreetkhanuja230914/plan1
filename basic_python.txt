a=0b # for python binary data type 
b=0x prefix for the hexadecimal form 
c=0o prefix for the octadecimal form 
bin() to convert to binary form from any other form 
oct() convert to octal form from any other form 
hex() convert to hexadecimal form from any other form 
also float can be represt as a exponential form like 1.2 e3 means 1200
in polar format you can use complex too like a+bj where a is a natural integer part and j is a imaginary part 
for conversion in integer 
1. We can convert from any type to int except complex type.
2. If we want to convert str type to int type, compulsary str should contain only integral
value and should be specified in base-10
for conversion in integer
1. We can convert any type value to float type except complex type.
2. Whenever we are trying to convert str type to float type compulsary str should be
either integral or floating point literal and should be specified only in base-10.
we can add and remove update items in set but in the frozen set the set is immutable and we cannot update it 
1. In general we can use bytes and bytearray data types to represent binary information
like images,video files etc
2. In Python2 long data type is available. But in Python3 it is not available and we can
represent long values also by using int type only.
3. In Python there is no char data type. Hence we can represent char values also by using
str type.
immutatble data types are - str,int,float ,bytes,complex,bool,range,tuple,frozonset
mutable datatype are- bytearray,list ,set,dict
\n==>New Line
\t===>Horizontal tab
\r ==>Carriage Return
\b===>Back space
\f===>Form Feed
\v==>Vertical tab
\'===>Single quote
\"===>Double quote
\\===>back slash symbol
Bitwise Operators:
We can apply these operators bitwise.
These operators are applicable only for int and boolean types
The most significant bit acts as sign bit. 0 value represents +ve number where as 1
represents -ve value.
positive numbers will be repesented directly in the memory where as -ve numbers will be
represented indirectly in 2's complement form.
ternary operator 
x=30 if 10<20 else 40 
left shift and right shift is done by bit itself 
identity operator is ,is not - used for address comparison
true if both refeerences are pointing to the same memory block 
membership operator if we want to check weather one element is present or not in tuple ,list or any other data structure 
eval Function take a String and evaluate the Result.
Eg: x = eval(“10+20+30”)
print(x)
Output: 60
%i====>int
%d====>int
%f=====>float
%s======>String type
del(x)
We can delete variables which are pointing to immutable objects.But we cannot delete
the elements present inside immutable object.
1. rstrip()===>To remove spaces at right hand side
2. lstrip()===>To remove spaces at left hand side
3. strip() ==>To remove spaces both sides
s.find(substring)
s.rfind(substring) index from the last first occureence reverse string 
index() method is same as find() except it gives val
# it will count the substring occurence and also it will take second and third arguement as a strating and end index print(s.count('a',3,7)) 
replace method to replace a substring with another string but as string are immutable new objects are created instead 
upper ,lower ,swapcase, capitalize(only first element of complete statement is capitalize) ,title(all the words first element capitalze) ,
starts_with(),end_with(),
isalnum()
isalpha()
istitle()
islower()
isspace()
