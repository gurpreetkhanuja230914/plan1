bin() to convert to binary form from any other form 
oct() convert to octal form from any other form 
hex() convert to hexadecimal form from any other form

in polar format you can use complex too like a+bj where a is a natural integer part and j is a imaginary part 
for conversion in integer 
1. We can convert from any type to int except complex type.
2. If we want to convert str type to int type, compulsary str should contain only integral
value and should be specified in base-10
